# Senate-Index
This project was developed as a final project for my programming paradigms class in the Spring of 2020.

## About
The goal of this project was to create a website which embraced a theme and used our basic web-dev skills to provide users with information regarding our theme. My partner and I picked a Senate Index to provide voters with information about four candidates for the upcoming senate election.
