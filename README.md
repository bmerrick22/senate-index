# Senate-Index
This project was developed as a final project for my programming paradigms class in the Spring of 2020.

## About
The goal of this project was to create a website which embraced a theme and used our basic web-dev skills to provide users with information regarding our theme. My partner and I picked a Senate Index to provide voters with information about four candidates for the upcoming senate election.

## Project Breakdown
This project was created using Node Express. It uses routing to handle page transitions and even makes use of the Google Maps API. We used PUG instead of HTML to format our pages. We also created a mock "loading screen" using Bootstrap.

## Development Info
